Functional dependencies describe the relationships between attributes in a relational database. Given a set of attributes in a relation, a functional dependency specifies that the values of certain attributes uniquely determine the values of other attributes. Here are some examples of functional dependencies:

Employee Information:

{EmployeeID} -> {FirstName, LastName, Position}
The EmployeeID uniquely determines the associated first name, last name, and position of an employee.
Product Information:

{ProductCode} -> {ProductName, UnitPrice}
The ProductCode uniquely determines the associated product name and unit price.
Customer Information:

{CustomerID} -> {FirstName, LastName, Email}
The CustomerID uniquely determines the associated first name, last name, and email of a customer.
Purchase Information:

{TransactionID} -> {ProductCode, Quantity, TotalPrice}
The TransactionID uniquely determines the associated product code, quantity, and total price of a purchase.
Supplier Information:

The SupplierID uniquely determines the associated supplier name, contact person, and phone number.
Order Information:

{OrderID} -> {CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount}
The OrderID uniquely determines the associated customer ID, order date, and total amount.
Inventory Information:

{ProductCode, WarehouseID} -> {StockQuantity}
The combination of ProductCode and WarehouseID uniquely determines the stock quantity in the inventory.
Employee Schedule:

{EmployeeID, Date} -> {ShiftStartTime, ShiftEndTime}
The combination of EmployeeID and Date uniquely determines the scheduled shift start and end times.

The combination of CustomerID and ProductCode uniquely determines the order date and quantity of a specific product by a customer.
