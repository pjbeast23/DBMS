Normalisation
Customer:
1NF: The table has a primary key (cust_id), and each cell contains only one value. So, it’s in 1NF.
2NF: All non-key attributes (name, street, town, pin_code) are fully functionally dependent on the primary key. So, it’s in 2NF.
3NF: There are no transitive dependencies. So, it’s in 3NF.
Sale:
1NF: The table has a primary key (sale_id), and each cell contains only one value. So, it’s in 1NF.
2NF: All non-key attributes (date, cust_id) are fully functionally dependent on the primary key. So, it’s in 2NF.
3NF: There are no transitive dependencies. So, it’s in 3NF.
Item:
1NF: The table has a primary key (item_id), and each cell contains only one value. So, it’s in 1NF.
2NF: All non-key attributes (name, stock, price, category) are fully functionally dependent on the primary key. So, it’s in 2NF.
3NF: There are no transitive dependencies. So, it’s in 3NF.
Supplier:
1NF: The table has a primary key (supp_id), and each cell contains only one value. So, it’s in 1NF.
2NF: All non-key attributes (name) are fully functionally dependent on the primary key. So, it’s in 2NF.
3NF: There are no transitive dependencies. So, it’s in 3NF.
Purchase:
1NF: The table has a primary key (pur_id), and each cell contains only one value. So, it’s in 1NF.
2NF: All non-key attributes (date, supp_id) are fully functionally dependent on the primary key. So, it’s in 2NF.
3NF: There are no transitive dependencies. So, it’s in 3NF.
SaleItem:
1NF: The table has a primary key (sale_id, item_id), and each cell contains only one value. So, it’s in 1NF.
2NF: All non-key attributes (quantity, sale_price, amount) are fully functionally dependent on the primary key. So, it’s in 2NF.
3NF: There are no transitive dependencies. So, it’s in 3NF.
PurchItem:
1NF: The table has a primary key (item_id, pur_id), and each cell contains only one value. So, it’s in 1NF.
2NF: All non-key attributes (quantity, purch_price, amount) are fully functionally dependent on the primary key. So, it’s in 2NF.
3NF: There are no transitive dependencies. So, it’s in 3NF.
Customer_phone:
1NF: The table has a primary key (phone, cust_id), and each cell contains only one value. So, it’s in 1NF.
2NF: There are no non-key attributes. So, it’s in 2NF.
3NF: There are no transitive dependencies. So, it’s in 3NF.
Supplier_phone:
1NF: The table has a primary key (phone, supp_id), and each cell contains only one value. So, it’s in 1NF.
2NF: There are no non-key attributes. So, it’s in 2NF.
3NF: There are no transitive dependencies. So, it’s in 3NF.
